⚠️ Disclaimer

This bot is still in early development and may contain unknown bugs or unfinished features. I haven’t had enough time to fully debug everything yet, but I wanted to share what I’ve built so far. Expect changes, improvements, and fixes in future updates.

🚀 Setup Instructions

Please note: some config options are currently placeholders and are not functional yet. These will either be implemented or removed in future updates.

Possibly add some fun commands

Checkban command (by case id)

Add verify command

Update embeds since most of them look ugly and shit
