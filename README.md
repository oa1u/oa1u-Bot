## 🚀 Quick Start

### 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Administrator access** to a Discord test server
- **Basic terminal/command line knowledge**

### 📥 Installation Steps

#### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/oa1u/oa1u-bot.git
cd oa1u-bot
```

```bash
npm install
```

This installs all required packages:
- `discord.js` - Discord API library
- Additional utilities and APIs for fun commands

#### 3️⃣ Configure the Bot

Navigate to the `/Config` directory and set up these essential files:

**`credentials.env`** - Bot Authentication
```env
TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
```

**`main.json`** - Core Server Configuration
```json
{
  "guildId": "your_server_id",
  "links": {
    "invite": "https://discord.gg/yourlink"
  }
}
```

**`presence.json`** - Bot Status Display
```json
{
  "status": "online",
  "activity": {
    "name": "/help | Helping communities",
    "type": "WATCHING"
  }
}
```

**`constants/` Directory** - Advanced Configuration

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `channel.json` | Log channels, ticket channels, and notification destinations |
| `roles.json` | Moderator, admin, and special role IDs for permission checks |
| `leveling.json` | XP rates, level thresholds, and reward roles |

node index.js
```

You should see a colorful startup message listing all loaded commands and events. ✅

Run this command in your server to verify everything is working!

### 💡 Configuration Best Practices

- **Use Discord Developer Mode** to easily copy IDs (User Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode)
- **Set up dedicated channels** for logs to keep your server organized
- **Review blocked words** regularly to match your community standards
- **Test moderation commands** in a private channel first
- **Configure role hierarchy** to match your server's moderation structure
